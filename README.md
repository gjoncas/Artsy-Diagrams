# Artsy Diagrams

I have repositories with Ti𝑘Z diagrams from <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Diagrammatic">philosophy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Econ-Diagrams">economics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Lacan-Mathemes">psychoanalysis</a>, and (soon) computer science.

The diagrams here come from various sources, such as engineering or poetry. Often, they involve computational features (such as loops or randomness) that make them interesting from a draftsman’s point of view.

The diagrams here are evocative less for their original meaning, and more for new possibilities of interpretation.
