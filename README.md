# Artsy Diagrams

I have repositories with TiùëòZ diagrams from <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Diagrammatic">philosophy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Econ-Diagrams">economics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Lacan-Mathemes">psychoanalysis</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/CS-Diagrams">computer science</a>.

The diagrams here come from various sources, such as engineering or poetry. Often, they involve computational features (such as loops or randomness) that make them interesting from a draftsman‚Äôs point of view.

The diagrams here are evocative less for their original meaning, and more for new possibilities of interpretation.
