# Artsy Diagrams

I have repositories with TiùëòZ diagrams from <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Diagrammatic">philosophy</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Econ-Diagrams">economics</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Lacan-Mathemes">psychoanalysis</a>, and (soon) computer science.

These diagrams come from various sources, such as engineering or graphic design. Often, they involve some interesting feature (such as loops or randomness) that make them a nice way to practice my draftsmanship.

I am less interested in their original meaning, and more in new metaphorical interpretations.
